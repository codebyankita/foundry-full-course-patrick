## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To follow along with the projects in this repository, you‚Äôll need the following tools:

- **Node.js** and **npm**: For JavaScript-based frontends and dependency management.
- **Foundry**: Install Foundry for smart contract development and testing (`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`).
- **MetaMask**: For interacting with testnets like Sepolia and ZKsync.
- **VSCode**: Recommended IDE with extensions like Hardhat Solidity and Prettier.
- **Git**: For version control and cloning this repository.
- **Testnet ETH and LINK**: Use faucets for Sepolia or ZKsync to fund your wallet.

### Recommended Tools

- **Testnet**: Sepolia (preferred for this course).
- **DevOps Tools**: [foundry-devops](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-devops) for deployment scripts.
- **Faucets**:
  - [Sepolia GCP Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
  - [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
  - [Infura Sepolia Faucet](https://docs.metamask.io/developer-tools/faucet)
  - [Chainlink Sepolia Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
  - [ZKsync Sepolia Faucet](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/ecosystem/network-faucets)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codebyankita/foundry-full-course-patrick.git
   ```

2. Install Foundry (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

3. Install dependencies for each project (where applicable):
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your private key, RPC URLs, and API keys (e.g., Etherscan, Alchemy). Example:
   ```bash
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
   ```

   > **Note**: Never commit your `.env` file or private keys to GitHub. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

5. Compile and test a project:
   ```bash
   cd 04-foundry-simple-storage
   forge compile
   forge test
   ```
